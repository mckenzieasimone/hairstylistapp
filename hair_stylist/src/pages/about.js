1. you sort the providers by distance, in sets of whole miles
    [3: 55 PM]
2. within a whole mile, you shuffle,
for fairness
    [3: 56 PM]
3. everything is free, but,
if a provider spends $n / month, they show up earlier in the list than they otherwise would.
    [3: 56 PM]
4. spending is per - topic.so some of them will go spend on lace - front wigs, some will spend on quick - install weaves, and you 'll see differentiation per topic. [3: 57 PM]
5. you start the $n / month very low, and every time someone buys, you increase the price a little bit.it 'll set its own correct price, per area.  the right price in beverly hills is different than the right price in compton. [3: 58 PM]
suppose you
break those up by zip code, because zip code is already by population density.
    [3: 58 PM]
there are 41, 962 zip codes in the us.about 10, 000 of them have non - trivial population.i would be willing to bet about 2, 000 have significant african american populations[3: 59 PM]
assuming there 's a zipf distribution where you have one provider in each of those 2,000 zips, and two providers in 200 of them, and three in 20 of them, and four in 2 of them, and five in 1 of them, that'
s 2473 providers
    [4: 00 PM]
assuming it 's $2/mo +1/mo/buyer, that'
s $4000 + $600 + $80 + $100 + $6 = $4786 / mo[4: 01 PM]
or about $60, 000 a year right there, off a first step
